Emergencies & Similar Useful Numbers
All of these numbers are free to call except where highlighted
(excluding any roaming charges on a mobile)

999 & 112 - 999 is the main emergency number in the UK which can be used to contact the Police, Ambulance service, Fire brigade and the Coastguard in an emergency. 112 is the European emergency number, which will work anywhere in the EU and in some other countries worldwide, it is more likely to work if you are calling while roaming on a UK network on a mobile phone. 911 will also work.

111 - This is a service known as NHS 111 that will connect you to a medical professional who will be able to help you obtain medical advice and help you in a non-emergency situation. If there is a medical emergency you should call 999

101 - This is a non-emergency number that can be used to contact the local Police force. This number used to cost 15p per call, but should now be free.

0800 111 999 - The gas emergency number. If you can smell gas, or suspect a gas leak, you should call this number to report it. The number should also be used if there is a Carbon Monoxide leak. More information: www.nationalgas.com/safety-and-emergencies/emergencies-and-safety-advice

105 - Call 105 to report a power cut. This number connects you to your local power network operator. www.powercut105.com/en/

159 - This is a new number launched in 2021 designed to connect you to your bank safely and securely if you are worried being scammed “If you think someone is trying to trick you into handing over money or personal details - stop, hang up and call 159 to speak directly to your bank” - stopscamsuk.org.uk/159/
How do UK numbers work
01, 02 - these are landline numbers.
03 - These are equivalent to landline numbers in cost, but do not represent a specific area, they are non-geographic.
05 - These used to exist, but don’t anymore.
07 - These are mobile phone numbers. Excluding 070xx for personal numbers which can cost more.
08 - Freephone numbers (see below)
09 - Premium rate numbers, these can cost stupid amounts of money to call.
Freephone numbers
The UK has Freephone numbers that can be called for free (it's in the name 😉)
They begin with 0800 or 0808. These numbers often have varying numbers of digits after 0800/0808. Numbers in the range 0808 80x xxxx are reserved for not-for-profit helplines.
For example, 0800 1111 is the number for Childline.
The number ranges 084x and 087x no longer exist and have moved to 034x and 037x respectively, these may cost more to call than normal 03, 02 and 01 numbers.

01 and 02 numbers (landlines)
Landline numbers will either start 01 and 02, all 01 and 02 numbers are landlines. A diagram showing how landline numbers are formatted can be found here:
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_the_Telephone_Dialling_Codes_in_the_United_Kingdom.png
Most UK landline numbers take the form 01AAA xxxxxx, where the ‘A’ digits are the ones that determine the area, and the ‘x’s make up the local number. This format is used in 543 areas of the UK.
For various reasons, such as historic area codes and big cities, some places have an area code that is 2,4,5 or 6 digits long, dont always assume that every place follows the 01AAA xxxxxxx format. For example in london, the codes 020 xxxx xxxx are used.
03 numbers (non-geographic)
These numbers are landline numbers.
03 numbers are non-geographic and do not apply to specific areas. They use the format 03xxx xxxxxx. They cost the same as any other landline call to 01 and 02 numbers
034x and 037x numbers have been moved from 084x and 087x (see above)-->
