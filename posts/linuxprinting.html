            <h1 id="title">How to print on linux without losing your sanity</h1>
            <p>Printing on linux can be a little confusing, this guide aims to walk through getting printing working easily.</p>
            <p>Printing on Linux is mainly done with <a href="https://openprinting.github.io/cups/">CUPS</a>, which provides the backend on many Linux distributions, although many distros add a frontend.</p>
            <p>If the frontent provides a poor interface, often the CUPS web interface can be used to get a better idea of what is avaialbel to use the printer, on port 631.</p>
            <h2>Method 1: IPP</h2>
            <p>The easisest way to get printing working on Linux right now is IPP, which is a standardised protocol designed to allow all printers to work in the same way. Apple brands its extention of IPP as AirPrint, so almost all printers that <a href="">support AirPrint</a> will work with Linux</p>
            <p>When adding a printer, using IPP will often provide the best results</p>
            <h2>Method 2: Drivers</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, either the printer doesn't work properly with IPP, or IPP does not support all of the printers features</p>
            <p>There is project called <a href="https://gimp-print.sourceforge.io/p_Supported_Printers.php">Gutenprint which offers drivers for many printers</a> and in some cases will work with the printer better than IPP</p>
            <p>Sometimes, the manafacturer provides their own drivers to work with their printers, these can often be a pain to install, but can work better than the other options as a last resort.</p>
