        <h1 id="title">How to save your sanity and get a better Minecraft launcher - Minecraft Part 1</h1>
        <div>
            <p>This guide will tell you how to install a better minecraft launcher. We're using ATLauncher as an example, as it runs well on even the worst hardware, and supports all types of unmodded and modded games</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>You might wonder why I seem to think that the default Minecraft launcher is <i>sanity destroying</i>. Well, maybe it's not quite that bad, but it still has a lot of short comings that are fixed in other launchers</p>
            <p><b>Modding - </b>The main reason is modpacks and semi-vanilla games. If you want to use an older version in the default launcher, you have to make a new instance, select the version from the stupidly long dropdown. If you want to install Fabric or Forge then you have to install that yourself. Furthermore, AtLauncher in paticular works a lot better, you can install the correct version of Fabric or Forge for your version of Minecraft with a few clicks, which would be a lot more tedious on the vanilla launcher.</p>
            <p><b>Multiple Sources - </b>launchers such as ATLauncher and Prism Launcher allow you to download mods from both CurseForge and Modrinth (which is a much nice platform than CurseForge) unlike other modpack launchers.</p>
            <h3>Ok, so how do install it then?</h3>
            <p>You can download <a href="https://atlauncher.com/downloads">ATLauncher from here</a> and you can also use <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism Launcher</a> but I wont be covering it here (It's still very good - it's just not one I've used.)</p>
            <p>ATLauncher uses Instances, which are versions of minecraft, you can create vanilla instances, or use modpacks.</p>
