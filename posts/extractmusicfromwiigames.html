            <div class="h3">Getting the game disc image</div>
            <p>If you have a <a href="https://www.wii.guide">softmodded Wii</a> you can use <a href="https://wii.guide/cleanrip.html">CleanRip</a> to get an ISO disc image of the game that can be played in an emulator.</p>
            <p>If you own the game but don't want to rip it you can get game ISOs online through websites like <a href="https://mariocube.com/">MarioCube</a></p>
            <div class="h3">Getting the music files</div>
            <p>You can use <a href="https://www.dolphin-emu.org">Dolphin Emulator</a> to view the contents of a Wii disc image by adding the ISO to Dolphin and right-clicking on the game, clicking properties and then the Filesystem tab. (Picture Coming Soon)</p>
            <p>In the game filesystem expand the data partition if you haven't already and find a folder named something like sound examples are: "sound", "media", "snd" and "bgm" and extract any files that look like songs they may be named "bgm", "voice, "music" etc.</p>
            <div class="h3">Converting music files</div>
            <p>Most music files used in wii games can be converted to wav using <a href="https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream">VGMstream</a> which you can run from the command line with the name of the music file</p>
            <p>If the file is in the BRSTM format you can user VGMstream or play it online using <a href="https://kenrick95.github.io/nikku/">Nikku</a></p>
            <p>If it is a BSRAR file then its very difficult to extract however you can try a fork of <a href="https://github.com/magcius/vgmtrans">VGMTrans</a></p>
            <p>There are various tools at <a href="https://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html">hcs64</a> related to ripping music but specifically the bsrar_tools section which has "ripping mama" and "bsrar_unpack" can unpack BSRARs</p>
            <p>I'll add more formats as I encounter them in games.</p>
